What is Middleware?
The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.
Why middleware is used in Express?
An Express-based application is a series of middleware function calls. Advantages of using middleware: Middleware can process request objects multiple times before the server works for that request. Middleware can be used to add logging and authentication functionality.
